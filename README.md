# FizzyBuzz_Challenge
Challenge 1:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. 

Challenge 2:
Write a function called prependToString, 
which accepts two strings.
The function should return a new string with the second string prepended to the first.
